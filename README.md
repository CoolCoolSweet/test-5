## test-5 - transforms and functional programming

Modify the transform function (in `transform.js`) to transform fromShape to toShape (in `index.js`)

commands:

`npm install` -> install dependencies

`node index.js` -> does the comparison, will print "SUCCESS!" if the object is the same (array / List order doesn't matter)
